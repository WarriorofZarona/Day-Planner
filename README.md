# Day-Planner
Homework #5

For this assignment, I need to develop a day planner that I can add important events to and plan on the daily.

The planner will display the current day, with timeblocks separated by the hour. It is color coded by past, present, and future. Clicking a timeblock will allow me to enter an event, and a button on the right will save the event. This will be stored in local storage. Refreshing the page allows the text to persist.

I will be utilizing moment.js library to work with date and time.
